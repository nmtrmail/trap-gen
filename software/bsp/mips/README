The BSP added to the cross-compiler in order to be used for the OS-emulation mechanisms of TRAP is composed of:

-- osemu.ld: linker script, exactly the same of idt.ld, only modified in order to put the start address at 0 and in order to link the exception
vectors.  Note that the symbol _stack is put at 5MB, since we suppose that we have 5 MB of RAM; in
case your system is different, change it.

All these files are copied inside mips-elf/lib. In order to use the BSP, simply specify -Tosemu.ld
as an additional parameter to gcc when performing the compilation.

It should in theory be possible to use the files in this folder with any recent version of the binutils,
gcc and newlib. Anyway they have been tested with: binutils-2.20.1.tar.bz2 gcc-4.5.0.tar.bz2 gdb-7.1.tar.bz2 newlib-1.18.0.tar.gz
