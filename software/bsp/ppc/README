The BSP added to the cross-compiler in order to be used for the OS-emulation mechanisms of TRAP is composed of:

-- libcStub.c: contains the stubs for the missing library routines (just placeholders for compilation purposes,
the functionality is imlpemented in hardware through OS emulation)
-- osemu.ld: linker script, exactly the same of the output of "powerpc-elf-ld --verbose" (the original linker script),
only modified in order to put the start address at 0.  Note that the symbol _stack is put at 5MB, since
we suppose that we have 5 MB of RAM; in case your system is different, change it.
-- osemu.specs: puts everything together, when specifying -specs=osemu.specs on the compiler command line,
this file is read in order to identify the start file (osemu-crt0.S), the linker script (osemu.ld) ...
To dump the specs currently in use, invoke gcc with the -dumpspecs option.

All these files (well, for libcStub.c, and osemu-crt0.S we consider the object file and not the source file)
are copied inside powerpc-elf/lib. In order to use them simple specify -specs=osemu.specs as an additional
parameter to gcc when performing the compilation.

File configOptions.txt contains the additional configuration option that were given to
the crossCreate.py script in order to create the cross-compiler

It should in theory be possible to use the files in this folder with any recent version of the binutils,
gcc and newlib. Anyway they have been tested with: binutils-2.20.tar.bz2 gcc-4.4.2.tar.bz2 gdb-7.0.tar.bz2 newlib-1.17.0.tar.gz
