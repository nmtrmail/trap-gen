In order to compile the tests run the command:
CC_CROSS=your_compiler CFLAGS=your_cflags make
remember to specify -DBIG_TARGET among the cflags in case you want to test
a big endian processor. For example, for the LEON3 processor:
CC_CROSS=/home/luke/cross/sparc/bin/sparc-elf-gcc CFLAGS="-DBIG_TARGET -specs=osemu.specs" make

Once compiled, to run the tests execute:
SIMULATOR=your_simulator make test
for exmple:
SIMULATOR=/home/luke/temp/processor/_build_/default/funcLT/funcLT make test

After tests execution you shall get a list of the failed tests. Note that all the output
written to standard error from the tests is written to a file called testName.trace (where
testName is the name of the test which failed). In case tracing is enabled in the processor,
this file contains also the output of the tracing process.
