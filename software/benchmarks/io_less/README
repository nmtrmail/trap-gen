This folder contains modified and reduced versions of the main benchmark applications
where the I/O operations and the calls to the operating system and to external libraries
has been minimized as much as possible.

The benchmarks are particularly built for the TSIM LEON in the sense that, at the
beginning, they contain instruction for disabling the processor's cache; such
caches are disabled if the pre-processor directive TSIM_DISABLE_CACHE is defined.
For using such benchmarks with TSIM the following compilation flags were used:
CFLAGS="-msoft-float -mcpu=v8 -DTSIM_DISABLE_CACHE -fno-inline" (note that the -mv8 flag does not
exists anymore in gcc 4.4 and it has to be replaced by -mcpu=v8); -fno-inline
is used because sometimes with -O3 wrong code was generated.
